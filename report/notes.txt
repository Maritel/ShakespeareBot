What counts as an "observation?"

There are about 3500 distinct words. Then O has dimensions [# states, ~3500]
which is quite undesirable. Despite this, we tried anyway, with 10 states, in
test1.py.
Some sample length-10 sequences:
impute astronomy oft restored called wert arrest that's buy zealous
shaken titles sufficed idolatry arrest mutual dian's zealous whether zealous
loveliness mutual mayst zealous zealous resort zealous zealous zealous zealous

Why is 'zealous' so common? Because every time, there's one state that favors
'zealous' immensely.
For example, in one run:
P(zealous | state i) = [  3.26546267e-08   7.07025288e-10   5.93471675e-05   1.32970137e-07
   9.28531004e-01   3.74419657e-06   3.74968293e-04   5.78826445e-01
   4.88150635e-01   1.16727845e-04]
As you can see, there's one state that goes to 'zealous' 93% of the time.
This is despite the fact that 'zealous' shows up quite literally once in all of
the sonnets.
